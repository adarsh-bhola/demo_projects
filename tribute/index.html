        <p align="justify">Kyojuro was a young adult of tall stature and lean-muscular build. He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks
             akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, 
             black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils. He was known to be
            <span style="color: red">charismatic</span> and had an air of great optimism, 
            having an enthusiastic smile plastered on his face nearly all the time.</p>
        
        <p align="justify">Kyojuro wore a paler brown version of the regular <span style="color: red;">Demon Slayer uniform</span>, 
            which consisted of a brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and tattsuke-hakama pants.
            Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end 
            that his father <span style="color: red;">Shinjuro</span> had once worn and more than likely his 
            father had worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively.</p> 
        <p align="justify">Finally, he wore red kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, 
            with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white z≈çri with red straps.When he first joined the Demon Slayer Corps,
            he only wore the regular Demon Slayer uniform but as he rose up the ranks, Kyojuro started wearing a completely 
            white haori before donning on his signature flame-patterned one.</p>

        <ul type="square">
            <li>greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira</li>
            <li>He was amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique</li> 
            <li>His swordsmanship was stemming from strict practice and discipline</li>
            <li>Kyojuro also loved his family immensely, displaying great respect and worry towards his father, Shinjuro Rengoku</li>
            <li>He, like most Demon Slayers, absolutely detested demons, usually because of their heinous deeds 
                because of their clashing moral values</li>
            <li>Despite this, Kyojuro recognized and accepted Nezuko as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps after seeing her 
                risk her life to protect innocents, showing that Kyojuro was capable of not letting his hatred for demons 
                cloud his judgement.
            </li>
            <li>Beneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyojuro was very logical and tactically intelligent, 
                acting quickly and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line.</li>

        <p align="justify">As a Hashira, Kyojuro possessed tremendous speed and reflexes, so much so that even gifted Demon Slayers 
            like Tanjiro and Inosuke Hashibira were unable to register his clash with Akaza, with the latter stating that
            he was on a different dimension. Kyojuro could even cause tremors to the ground and nearly launching a train off its
            tracks by running at such high speeds.Moreover, Kyojuro could easily move at speeds much faster than the eye can see,
            decapitating demons before they can even react.</p><br>
        <p align="justify">Kyojuro displayed superhuman stamina and endurance during his battles over the course of the series.
            In his battle with the Flute Demon, Kyojuro ruptured his eardrums, yet didn't flinch in the slightest, 
            ignoring the pain and continuing to fight and win.</p> <br><br>

        <p align="justify">Having spent years of perfecting his physical prowess, Kyojuro possessed amazing physical strength, 
            being capable of swinging his katana at speeds faster than the eye can see incessantly with faultless accuracy
            while engaging in combat and even sending Akaza flying an astonishing distance into a forest with a single blade swing.
            Kyojuro could also lift an entire train off its tracks by simply dashing forward.</p>

        <p align="justify">As a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was one of the most powerful and skilled swordsmen 
        in the entire organization.Additionally, Kyojuro is part of the Rengoku family which has an impressive lineage of 
        powerful swordsmen and Flame Hashira, giving Kyojuro an edge in developing and polishing his swordsmanship.
        His extraordinary swordsmanship skill has been displayed on multiple occasions across the series.</p><br>
        
        <p align="justify"><span style="color: crimson;">Flame breathing</span>is a breathing Style taught to Kyojuro by the 
            previous Flame Hashira, Shinjuro Rengoku, and later mastered by reading the instruction books left behind by previous
            Flame Hashira in the Rengoku Family.As the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro is his generation's most skilled Flame Breathing user.
            He became evidently proficient in fighting with this Breathing Style, being able to singlehandedly defeat former 
            Lower Rank Two, Hairo and later hold his own against Upper Rank Three, Akaza.</p><br>
